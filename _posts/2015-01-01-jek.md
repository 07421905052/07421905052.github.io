I'm currently a level 2 student studying Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University of Leeds. I am quite interested in programming and patient enough to find the bugs in my code. I’m also full of passion to learn and use the concepts which I haven’t encountered in my courses. As a result, even the upcoming tasks are unfamiliar to me, I’ll still try my best to find solutions to them. What’s more, I have accumulated a certain amount of experiences of using oscilloscope, multimeters and apparatus like that. So I believe that I can use them well in the laboratory.
